# US-Home-Price-Analysis
## Project Overview
The "US Home Price Influence Analysis" project aims to analyze the key factors that have influenced US home prices over the last 20 years. By leveraging the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the project identifies trends, evaluates influential variables, and provides time series forecasting to predict home prices for the next 5 years.

## Key Features
- **Historical Analysis**: Examines the impact of economic, social, and market factors on US home prices.
- **Data Source**: Uses the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as the primary proxy for home prices.
- **Forecasting**: Implements time series modeling to project future trends in home prices.

## Objectives
1. Identify and quantify the key factors influencing home prices in the US over two decades.
2. Analyze the relationship between these factors and historical price trends.
3. Predict future home price trends to assist in strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
- **Primary Source**: S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index
- **Time Period**: Last 20 years
- **Data Characteristics**: Includes economic indicators, market metrics, and housing-related factors.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess historical data from reliable sources.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and interpret data trends and patterns.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Identify key factors through statistical analysis.
   - Perform time series forecasting for the next 5 years using advanced modeling techniques.
4. **Validation**: Evaluate model performance and refine predictions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Libraries for Time Series Analysis**: statsmodels, Prophet
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Version Control**: Git
